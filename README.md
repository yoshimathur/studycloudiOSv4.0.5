Study Cloud for iOS version 4.0.5

By connecting students within the same school, students can receive tutoring in the best way possible. Through Study Cloud, older students can find clients to tutor and earn some quick cash while younger students can get help from the people that have gone through the same classes with the same teachers. This type of tutoring has been unheard of. Rather than getting help from a tutor who has no clue on what your schooling system and your teachers are like, use Study Cloud to get help from someone who knows exactly what you're going through.
